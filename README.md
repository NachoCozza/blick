# Blick
Blick was a game developed for the 2 month challange for EVA 2017 (Argentinian Videogame Expo)
This game was developed in 2 months, and the theme for the challange was "Perspective"
Blick won the 3rd place in the challange, and our team was awarded with a free course of our choice in Image Campus


# About the game
Blick is a casual infinite runner, in which the main mechanic is that the playar can control the perspective of the camera, by switching from 2D to 3D. All the collisions and physics react to this perspective change, and some obstacles can only be avoided in one of the perspectives
